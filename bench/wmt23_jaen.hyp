Rabies infection increased in northeastern Thailand
Dr. Tawichai, the 9th Disease Prevention Management Office, said on February 9 that rabies infections increased in northeastern Thailand over the past few months, with a total of 74 infections.
In this fiscal year (October last year - September this year), 74 people in total, 67 and 7, were positive for rabies tests so far in Surin and Buriram prefectures in the northeast.
All of them have been vaccinated against rabies in the past.
The physician is calling on people to get rabies vaccination with their pets and not to touch the saliva of suspected animals.
Rabies can be transmitted not only to dogs but also to cats and bats.
When a person is infected and develops, almost 100% of people die, but vaccination before onset can prevent death.

However, this time, the business office supported a farm in Kagamishiro-gun, which is adjacent to the city, not in Kiyotsu City.

FUJI To prevent accidents left behind In-house system development experiments in-house |
FUJI (headquartered Chiryu City), which manufactures and sells robots and machine tools, has embarked on the development of a system to prevent "leaves" such as leaving children behind in the car.
A motion sensor is installed inside the car, and when a person's movement is detected, a phone call or chat is sent to the notification.
Currently, we are conducting a demonstration experiment with the vehicle pick-up vehicle at our facility.
Protecting the safety of children in the midst of the tragic accidents caused by being left behind.
Currently, we are conducting a demonstration experiment with two pick-up vehicles from the English conversation after-school "Teracoya Thank" which is operated in-house in Chiryu city.
A motion sensor that detects the movement of a person from the difference in temperature between the people and the surroundings is installed on three ceilings inside the car.
When the engine of the vehicle is turned off and the door is closed, a warning is automatically sent when a certain time has passed.
By linking the status of the engine or door and the information, misdetection is prevented as much as possible.
Alert notifications are sent through the cloud.
In addition to calling the number you registered in advance, it will be displayed in the chat on your computer or smartphone.
You can register multiple addresses so that you don't make mistakes such as missing out.
The demonstration experiment will continue until the end of February.
"During the experiments, I've come to see some other issues other than the system," said Isomitsu Kamiya, Section 2 of the Innovation Promotion Department.
It is said that he was able to pick up various issues related to school buses, such as creating an environment where drivers can concentrate on driving.
"We want to expand our solutions," he said.
The development of the anti-learning system was caused by the abandonment of shuttle buses across the country.
Employees with young children have suggested that they can do something to keep their children safe.
We decided to develop it in an attempt to make use of know-how such as IoT (Internet of Things) and information management using sensors, which we have cultivated through our business related to FA (Factory Automation).
FUJI's leftover prevention system is easy to use.
The sensor can be installed by simply pinning it to the ceiling.
Since it can be easily retrofitted to a pick-up vehicle, it will lower the hurdles of introduction and aim to spread it.
In the future, we will consider commercialization with the cooperation of nursery schools and kindergartens.
[Instructor] The Hokuriku Shinkansen Tsuruga-Shin-Osaka construction, which was scheduled for the beginning of fiscal 2023, has been postponed, and the town development in Fukui prefecture is beginning to be affected.
In Obama City, where the new station will be set up, the detailed location of the station is still not shown, and urban planning, including the maintenance of the surrounding area, is at a standstill.
It is expected that it will take a long time to formulate a plan, and it will be required to be announced as soon as possible.
The Hokuriku Shinkansen station, which is scheduled in Obama City, will be the only new station development west of Tsuruga.
In 2019, the Railway Construction and Transportation Facility Development Agency announced that the station was roughly located at a radius of about 2.5 kilometers, centered on JR Higashi-Ohama Station.
It was aiming for the winter of 2012 to determine the detailed station location and route.
In 2021, the business related to the Shinkansen, which was about to open Tsuruga in Kohama City and was anticipated to open, began in earnest in fiscal 2021.
In the initial budget for fiscal 2010, we are trying to further increase the number of projects and promote urban development that anticipates the announcement of the location of the new station.
However, the detailed location of the new station has not yet been shown.
The city is considering land use and maintenance concepts based on the location of the new station, and plans to formulate a basic plan for the current fiscal year's budget of 3 million yen, but it is expected that it will not be executed.
City planning centered on the new station "It takes time for citizens to consensus," said a city official.
There is a case of Echizen city at a new suburban station in the prefecture that is not attached to the existing JR station, but it can be seen that it takes a considerable amount of time to complete the overall plan.
It is feared that the later the announcement is made, the shorter the preparation period for the opening of the business will be and the impact it will have on the maintenance of the surrounding area.
Before the location of the new station, there is a sense of uncertainty about the extension west of Tsuruga.
In October last year, a citizen's group in Kyoto City on the extension route submitted a signature to the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism, calling for the withdrawal of the extension plan.
In Ishikawa Prefecture's political circles, there has been a series of moves to return the set routes to the beginning, such as calls for reconsideration of the Maibara route after construction has been postponed.
It is relatively calm about the way the citizens of Obama's acceptance is being postponed, but if the location of the new station is unknown and the opening date remains uncertain, there are concerns that future momentum will be affected.
Mayor Koji Matsuzaki plans to continue to make requests to the government to open the entire line as soon as possible.
With the indifference that "the bullet train will pass (to the west of Tsuruga) at some point," the country and neighboring prefectures cannot be moved.
I want the enthusiasm to keep raising my voice.
Valentine's Day chocolate counter for the first time in 3 years = February 9, the Seibu Fukui store in Fukui City, Fukui Prefecture
In front of Valentine's Day on February 14th, as the prices of raw materials and packaging materials soared, the prices of chocolate in the store were rising.
Retail shops and confectionery shops in Fukui Prefecture are trying to attract customers with products that show their attention to local colors, luxury, and materials.
On January 25th, the Seibu Fukui store (Fukui City) opened a special sales floor at the event hall on the 6th floor.
Until the 14th, about 450 types of 45 brands, including 10 confectionery shops in the prefecture, are on sale.
Chocolates made with local Fukui sake and sandwich products made of cookies sandwiched between raw chocolate are popular.

Regarding this year's trends, "Many of the products show their characteristics, such as sticking to the ingredients and adding a sense of luxury to the package. As for consumer trends, there is a tendency to enjoy eating and comparing foods."
Sales in the high price range are said to be strong among headwinds that raise prices.
⇒ Average increase of 25 yen per grain due to high prices
"We are trying to create a sales floor where you can enjoy the event itself called Valentine's Day," said the person in charge.
From January 26th, the store has been selling recommended sweets, and the tasting has resumed for the first time in three years.
The Western Confectionery Club (Handaka Maruoka-cho, Sakai-shi, Ippon-Danaka), which manufactures and sells confectionery, is a long-established French chocolate maker at the end of last year. For the first time, the series of original chocolate "KISEKI" jointly developed with Car was launched into Valentine's sales battle.
They are particular about cocoa beans, and are characterized by a fruity taste with less bitterness, and are sold for 1,000 yen for 3 pieces and 3,000 yen for 9 pieces.
Ryoma Takakura, director of the purchasing department, said, "While the in-law chocolate culture is gradually fading, there is a demand for enjoying a little luxury on Valentine's Day. We will increase the added value of the product and try to differentiate itself."

On the 9th, a female office worker (Fukui City), who visited the Seibu Fukui store, said, "I've always loved chocolate, so I've come to get a job and get paid, so I want to buy it as a reward for myself."
A female office worker in her 30s who bought in-law chocolate said, "It hurts that the price hike goes to chocolate, but since it's only once a year, I'd like to give it to my family and the person who usually takes care of me. However, the number of people who give it to me may be reduced."

Aikawa Ukyo nosuke Tokiharu, who was an official of the Kamakura shogunate, was dispatched to Ohno as Jito.
In 1333, Rokuhara Tandai, which was established in Kyoto to monitor the imperial court and to rule the western part of the country, was overthrown by Ashikaga Takauji, and the Kamakura shogunate was destroyed by Yoshisada Nitta.
When he heard the news that the Rokuhara Tandai had perished, Osamu's servants quickly fled, leaving only about 20 of them.
Taking advantage of that opportunity, the monk soldiers of Heisenji attacked.
After having his wife and two children into the river, Tokiharu followed him and killed himself.

A cat-shaped serving robot introduced at "Rock Salt Aged Genghis Khan Bonta Fukui Ekimae Branch".
Favorable facial expressions such as family customers are popular with family customers = 2-chome, Fukui City, Fukui Prefecture
In the food and beverage industry in Fukui Prefecture, which is suffering from a labor shortage, there is a growing movement to introduce food serving robots that carry food to the audience.
It is said that it is popular with family customers for its lovely expression of robots, which is useful for "non-contact" customer service, as well as the labor saving of the store management and the prevention of the new corona virus infection.
Restaurant owners and officials have said, "It's difficult to secure employees and part-time jobs at local restaurants, and food delivery robots will become even more popular."
"Jin, Jin, Genghis Khan♪".
While playing light music, a robot with a cat's face on the screen runs smoothly in the store with food on it.
When you arrive at the table in the audience, you will talk to the customer, "I brought you the food you ordered."
In August 2022, a cat-shaped serving robot was introduced for "Rock Salt Aged Genghis Khan Bonta Fukui Ekimae Branch" in Ote 2-chome, Fukui City.
If you put the food ordered by the customer on the robot waiting near the kitchen and press the table number on the screen, it will run autonomously to that table and deliver it.
It has built-in AI (artificial intelligence) voice function, and it reacts when the customer touches it, and the expression of the cat face on the screen is rich.
The "Bonta Group", which runs the same store, has introduced a serving robot at two stores, including the same store.
President Toshiyuki Saito said that the reason for the introduction was "the biggest labor shortage" and that it was part of the improvement of productivity through labor-saving and digital transformation (DX).
The ratio of labor costs to store sales is usually about 30%, but the introduction has reduced it to 21 to 22%.
The robot has the role of collecting the plates that the customers have finished eating, which leads to the efficiency of cleaning up afterwards, and adds that "family and children are happy and have an advertising effect."
In August 2012, the Rokuken Hoshiyama Fukui store, which is a yakiniku and offal hot pot in Araki Shinbocho, Fukui City, also introduced a serving robot.
Eifuku Hoshiyama, the president of Sungsan Shoten, who runs the business, said, "Even if you recruit employees or part-time workers, it's hard to come. I thought it would be absolutely necessary to solve the labor shortage."
At the Fukui store, it is operated by separating the zone where the employees serve and the range of robot delivery.
The leasing fee for a robot is about the same as the wages for a part-time worker.
In order to save labor, the store has adopted an ordering system for robots and tablet terminals, and is considering self-checkout.
According to the Fukui Labor Bureau, in December 2010, the number of active job openings-to-applicants ratio by job type was 6.94 times, which is a high level of labor shortage.
A person in charge of the Internet system (2-chome Takagi-Chuo, Fukui City), which is the sales agent for serving food robots, said, "Because of the corona misfortune, the labor shortage at restaurants in the prefecture is becoming more serious, and we receive many inquiries about the introduction of robots."
"It will be even more difficult to secure employees at local suburban stores, and I think the food-serving robots will become more popular," Hoshiyama said.
[Article] Echizen town has created ending notes and distributes them to the townspeople who wish to do so.
It is said that when a family member was issued a "Okuyami Handbook" that covers the necessary procedures, a list of written inheritances, and family diagrams, which are necessary for the death of a relative, many people came to pick it up for themselves two years ago.
In various parts of the prefecture, lectures on how to write ending notes and how to organize the life are often held, and it seems that "shukatsu" is firmly established among the citizens of the prefecture.
The ending note of Echizen town is 35 pages.
Starting with a review of your personal history in Chapter 5, we will write down the current health status, asset status, future nursing care, hope for terminal care, and requests for funerals and graves.
There is also a column for what you want to do in the rest of your life and a message to your loved ones.
It's hard to write that there are 35 pages, but you don't need to fill in all the pages.
What do you want to write down to your family and others?
The key is to clarify the purpose.
At bookstores, etc., various notebooks are commercially available according to the purpose, and you can feel free to start writing from where you can write.
It is said that the term "shukatsu" was born in 2009, like a job hunting.
Two years later, in 2011, the Great East Japan Earthquake occurred.
It is said that many people have witnessed the reality that "death comes suddenly" and that more and more people are preparing for their own end and end stages of life.
It's been over 10 years since then.
The corona pandemic that hit the world has not yet come to an end.
Prices have risen due to the invasion of Russia by Russia, and electricity prices have jumped to unexpected prices this winter.
On the other hand, wages have not risen to the extent that the current prices are high, and many people are struggling with the future.
On the other hand, there used to be funeral expenses, nursing care fees, and grave management, which were once shared by siblings and relatives.
In addition, although the life expectancy has increased significantly compared to a decade ago, the dilemma increases the risk of dementia and nursing care required as you get older.
It is important to keep in mind that this rise of social unrest is behind the fact that the end of life has not ended in a temporary way.
In any case, everyone wants to not put too much burden on their partners and children.
It seems that the key word is to be the ending notes, but don't be too complacent.
Instead of secretly writing down your wishes and requests, you should consult with your family and prepare for that time calmly.
Prime Minister Fumio Kishida (second from the right) and Minister of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (third person) who are photographed with the people involved at the elementary school he visited.
At the graduation ceremony, he indicated that it is not necessary for children and teachers to wear masks in principle = February 10, Toda City, Saitama Prefecture.
On February 10, the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology decided to "do not wear masks" for children wearing masks at the graduation ceremony.
A junior high school principal in a large school reveals, "It's actually difficult to keep the distance between the students, and I'm worried about how to deal with it. Some students feel uneasy about removing the mask."
It is said that this topic has been raised among teachers after receiving reports of wearing masks at graduation ceremonies.
On the other hand, one elementary school principal predicted, "If the government decides, it will probably not be worn. If the chorus is excluded, it may be possible to deal with it realistically."
At this graduation ceremony, there is also a move to seek relaxation of measures at some schools in the prefecture, such as allowing students to participate in the school who had been restrained and resumed the chorus of alumni.
In the prefecture, the prefectural high school will hold a ceremony in early March, and the public elementary and junior high school will hold a ceremony in the middle of the same month.
The prefectural board of education and the municipal board of education are planning to wait for a formal notice from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology and decide how to respond.
There were also some cautious voices about the fact that the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology has decided not to wear masks in all school education activities since the new semester this spring.
The principal of the elementary school said, "From one day, children are confused when they suddenly don't wear a mask. It's natural for the number of children to take off their clothes after deciding that they are free to wear."
× × ×
On February 10, the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology has decided not to ask for a mask to be worn in school education activities from April in accordance with the new government guidelines for wearing masks.
In principle, there are no masks in chorus, physical education classes, or club activities.
During fiscal 2022, we will ask for infection control measures according to the current sanitation management manual, and we will inform the board of education and schools about precautions from April onwards.
Graduation ceremonies such as elementary, junior high and high schools and universities will take measures such as ventilation during the 2012 period, and it is based on the basic that graduates, faculty members, and participating students do not wear masks.
Mr. Yasushi Nagata, who cuts the examinee (left) with scissors that he prayed for success = Hair atelier rim in Tsukamachi, Echizen City, Fukui Prefecture
At the hair salon hair shop in Tsukamachi, Echizen City, Fukui Prefecture, she cuts the students using scissors to pray for success during the exam season every year.
It is said that the students were well received, saying, "I've gained confidence" and "I've calmly approached the exam."
Yasushi Nagata, the representative director of the beauty salon, has seen and heard of students who open textbooks while waiting for a cut and express their anxiety about taking exams while cutting.
Therefore, in 2014, he started a prayer cut, saying, "I hope it will be of some help."
⇒Aggregation of the final date of application for national and public university applications
At the same beauty salon, on the first day of work, I ask for scissors and combs to pray for success at Kazusosha in Wakatake-cho, the same city.
About 80 people get cuts every year.
In addition to high school and university entrance exams, there are various employment exams, driver's license exams, etc.

The book "Dear Prime Minister "Breakwater of Life" from Tojinbo" published by the NPO "Everything of the Anthology / Editorial Bureau" self-published.
"Dear Prime Minister, 'The Breakwater of Life', Tojinbo" I self-published the 10th book with this title.
Newspapers from all over the country have covered it, and many readers have sent impressions.
The purpose of publishing this book is to share with everyone what the suicide attempters have directly heard about the causes of suicide in Japan, and to create a "comfortable society."
For 18 years and 10 months, we patrolled rocks at Tojinbo's waterfronts, which are known as suicide spots in Fukui Prefecture, and continue to support them until they find and protect suicide attempters and start again.
This book is a summary of the problems we have heard from 784 people (as of February 6) who have been protected so far, and appeals to the following seven items to the Prime Minister regarding measures necessary to prevent suicide.
(1) Suicide prevention activities are "life-saving" activities.
(2) A pile of "human rights violations" behind suicide.
(3) Suicides are victims of social and structural organized crime.
(4) Administrative agencies treat citizens outside their jurisdiction as "outsiders" and treat them coldly.
(5) Even if a person with a mental disorder such as depression is drugged and commits suicide, he is treated as an "accident".
(6) The "obligation to consider safety" in high-risk areas of suicide has been forgotten and it is running into a commercial principle.
(7) The part of the doctrine of a new religious organization that cannot be scientifically proven is a deception, and the act of threatening the other party and providing money and goods by telling the curse of the future is extortion.
Religious groups that carry out this "fraud/extortion" criminal act should be made public and excluded.
Therefore, I received a comment from a person who subscribed to this book, "I was moved by the strong mentality of the people working on this activity," and "The appearance of this former police officer is a model among the police." It's a living bodhisattva who is like a stranger, even though he's a stranger."
When I saw a photo of a newspaper article, I was in tears, thinking, "What are you thinking?"
I've heard that the number of people who have been cornered by the corona pandemic is increasing.
It's really sad.
Everyone is like that person.
I hope that the society will be able to live happily with the life you receive.
I felt a sense of respect and gratitude to all the staff who gave their hearts to those who had the pain that they wanted to die.
I think that this activity is an activity that abuses both physically and mentally, but please take care of yourself and continue to call out to us.
Thank you very much.
Kashiko
I hope that all of you, who are readers, will be the gatekeepers of life in the area.

Kenji Shimada, who shoots capybaras every week and posts photos on social media = On February 1st, on February 1, the indoor facility "Hapijang" at Asuwayama Park amusement park in Fukui City, Fukui Prefecture.
There is a man in the city who takes pictures of capybara every week of the indoor facility "Hapijan" at Asuwayama Park amusement park in Fukui Prefecture and posts it on Instagram.
In the post, there are a wide variety of thumbnail images, such as the moment of peeping out of a big mouth and yawning, and the appearance of lying down and basking in the sun.
There are more than 10,000 followers in Japan and overseas, and it plays a role in letting many people know about the charm of Hapijan and Capybara.
⇒ Shizuka Kudo posted traditional vegetables from Fukui prefecture on Instagram
The man is Kenji Shimada (38), a company employee who lives in the city.
In March 2021, we started posting on the exchange site (SNS).
Capybara is one of the largest rats in the world, and is good at swimming with watering between the fingers.
Hapijan has been breeding a total of 3 males and 2 females since 18, when it opened, and can be observed and feeding up close.
Shimada-san learned about Capybara five or six years ago.
He said that he was shocked when he saw a video of him relaxing in a hot spring and wondering, "What is this animal?"
I was drawn to her charming expression and gestures like a human.
After that, I heard that it would be bred in Hapijan, and I was looking forward to seeing it nearby.
About three years ago, I bought a single-lens reflex camera when I started taking pictures in earnest.
It's used to capture the lovely figure of a capybara, and you can't miss the photo opportunity, such as the figure of the body trembling and the water draining like a drill.
The number of posts posted on Instagram has risen to about 830, and he looks back, saying, "You've taken this much."
It seems that Yamato-kun approached him and yelled, "Kyurukyuru!"
"It's cute and I'm happy," said Mr. Shimada's love for capybaras.
Through SNS, he enjoys interacting with capybaras all over the country, showing the best shots every month.
Mr. Shimada, who visits zoos in nearby prefectures to see capybaras, said with a smile, "I want to continue shooting and transmitting, mainly on Mt. Asuwa, the platform of the platform."

Of these, 71 tons of lighting and air conditioning, including 1,321 tons, accounted for about 90% of emissions from 7 facilities such as airport terminal buildings, followed by 84 tons of air lights and 71 tons of airport vehicles.
The council will discuss the reduction in the amount of facilities and vehicles emitted.

"Inverted Real Estate" Established the Okinoerabu branch office Recruiting landlords for landlords |
The opening event that deepened the understanding of "upside down real estate" through talk sessions, etc. = 8th, Chinamachi
[Okinoerabu General Bureau] Realize the real estate web service that recruits lenders by visualizing the thoughts of those who want to try renting vacant houses or vacant stores. On the 8th, the Okinoera branch office opening event of "upside down real estate" was held at the community space "entaku" in Chimyo, Chinamachi.
The operating company provides an overview of the service through a talk session.
Masahiro Okubo, the representative director of Tsuginova (Riri-gun, Hokkaido), who is in charge of the operation of the branch office, said, "By carrying out this initiative on Okinoerabu Island, we can move and create a flow that attracts people to the entire island."
Contrary to normal real estate procedures, upside-down real estate is a system in which you disclose the information of the person you want to rent, contact the landlord, and if you reach an agreement, you will sign a contract yourself.
It was operated by ON-CO Co., Ltd. (headquartered in Mie Prefecture) as a demonstration experiment to excavate and build relationships through vacant houses, and started service in June 2020.
This is the 7th case in which the branch office has been opened for the first time in Kyushu.
It is the first remote island in Japan.
About 20 people, including ON-CO and Tsuginova staff, Wadomari, and local officials from both the townspeople and local residents, participated in the event.
Okubo, representative director, explained the details of the establishment of the branch office, saying, "While the movement to attract people outside the island is becoming more active, I thought that the town would be more lively from there if vacant houses and vacant stores could be used."
"We want to connect with people who own properties on the island or want to do something, and we want to help with as many of the people as possible," he said.
ON-CO's representative, Takeshi Mizutani, pointed out points to be aware of when operating, saying, "It is necessary to cherish each vacant house and discuss what locals want to do in this area, what kind of people they want to come, and what criteria they choose based on."
"The deeper the connection between people, the more information will be gathered," he called on the islanders to participate in discussions and cooperate with the provision of information.

For the time being, I think it's 50 points because I made the weapon properly and finished it.
If I hadn't crushed each mold or detail with a thick coating, I think I could have appreciated it a little more.
Do you have a Mercari Mercard?
Mercari doesn't think it's very convenient because the amount you sell is used for the purchase.
I went through the procedure for the first time. . .
I haven't used it yet.
I don't think the products listed will be cheaper yet. . .
There may be campaigns such as discounts if you use a card?
Does the NSR250R blink when the key is turned on while the engine is not running and the blinker is operated?
If the battery is normal, if you turn on the key, the ACC, that is, accessories, will be energized, so the blinkers and brake lights will turn on.
It will be a horn too.
However, after starting the engine, the voltage will increase, so it will be fine.
Can ADATA DDR4 and Samsung DDR4 be mixed together?
It's a laptop.
In principle, if the PIN sequence, voltage, frequency, etc. are the same, they can be used together.
If it's just the difference in frequency, it's designed to work with the slower one, but depending on the item, it may not work well, so it's not absolutely okay.
If you're going to serve customers sleepy in the morning, shouldn't you get into the futon early the day before?

Don't you think that you were able to work until retirement due to the merits of Uchisuke?
Retirement money was earned by the couple.
It is used for living expenses after retirement.
Of course, I admit the merits of the inside.
I'd like to repeat "from a certain place" in an MP4 file, but is there any free software?
Or can you do it with the software in Windows 10?
With VLC Media Player, you can play "A-B loop between"
However, since it is not possible to memorize between A and B, it is necessary to specify each time.
I'm on the 2001 2011 Crown Estate.
It's a 1J turbo.
I'm considering replacing the MT of R154, but how much will it cost including the mission? ?
If you know more about it, please advise.
Are you ignoring the harness, control, or settings?

I think you should have a million more than one million.
I have fat around my stomach and buttocks, do you look fat?
The upper half of the body feels like a middle-aged and overweight belly, but the lower half of the body is big! There is an impression.
Overall, it seems to have a pretty big impression.
It seems that this kind of thing came when my nephew was surfing the Internet, but is it okay to do everything in my power?
If you don't enter various things from here, it's a lie to say that you've registered, so you can ignore it.
Is this thin hair?
It is a "crack" of the hair due to the hairstyle.
If you continue to wear this kind of hairstyle, if you comb or brush your hair incorrectly, you can easily get thinning hair, so be careful.
If you don't make a mistake in combing it, it's hard to get thinning hair.
If you don't want to see the skin on your skin, you can change the hairstyle to a way that doesn't break your hair, and the problem will be solved.
Is this Dunhill wallet real?
If it's purchased at a famous department store such as Takashimaya, it will be guaranteed, so it can be said that it is genuine without a doubt, but isn't that the case? ?
As a gift or something! ?
If it's suspicious, have a local pawn shop or a brand-purchase shop appraisal for you.
Did a club adviser who had no experience in club activities when he was a student?
If you don't have any experience as an advisor for club activities, it's not necessarily because you don't have any other experienced club members (including those who are already in charge of advisors for other club activities).
I'm a high school student.
It's been getting colder little by little lately, so I've started wearing black stockings.
If you think you're cold, you can wear them.
You don't have to match when to wear it around.
So if you get sick
At night, my legs and legs are so itchy that I can't sleep.
Why is my legs and legs so itchy at night?
Maybe there are ticks.
It's better to dry the futon once in a while.
Why is it said that if it has a structure less than 1/20 of the wavelength, it can be approximated with a continuous medium?
This is because, in equations, the effect of scattering is in the form of structure/λ, so a small value is fine as a continuation.

Godiva is good.
It's a bit expensive, but there are some very simple chocolates, so I recommend it.
Do you live alone?
Do you enjoy something?
I lived alone.
Until last year.
It was fun.
Humans are familiar animals, so if every day continues to be pleasant, that state becomes everyday.
If it's fun but becomes a daily routine, it's not "fun" unless it's more fun.
I understand it, so "nothing with nothing" is fun.
I feel
Do you want to put a lot of tempura on the cup yakisoba?
There is no eating habit of adding tempura dregs to yakisoba...

Will it be less likely to stick with magnets if I painted stainless steel with a spray paint spray?
It depends on the magnetic force, but it will be.
Or rather, as Mr. No. 1 wrote, stainless steel does not have a magnet, so it is probably a low-purity stainless steel mixed with iron.
It's a common story in Chinese-made bogus stainless steel.
Even if you go out with a lover who is so friendly that you can meet once in a lifetime, parting will eventually come.
Are there many patterns in which the actual marriage partner is different?
Marriage has a certain amount of momentum and timing.
We got married so much that we didn't know if we would meet once in a lifetime.
I'm on the UR3 bezel now.
It's a medium term 2017, but I'd like to make this a late version of the final model, but it seems that just replacing the lights is not enough.
Has anyone had a late-term specification for the middle of the first half?
How much did it cost?
Also, what else did you do other than the light?
If anyone has more information, please let me know.
It's generally cheaper to buy the late term.
Tonight.
Thank you for your answer.
I think "computers = games or comics"
I don't think it's funny.

Each person.
Is it because some people find it interesting that the industry is built?
How would you feel if the woman you liked kept all the chocolate boxes that you gave them so far?
It's OK if you leave it for something, so it's OK, but if not, I'm a little worried that it might become a reserve army for the garbage mansion.
Why do elderly people like priority seats?

I only see young people sitting in priority seats about 1 out of 10 times.
Why?
Priority seats are for elderly people with bad legs and people with disabilities.
Do you think it's okay to wear the polo shirt in the image below in casual office?
It's a clerical job that isn't as hard as a bank or a securities company.
I think it's important to match the atmosphere of the employees around you.
First of all, why don't you try to make a decision by observing the people in the company?
I think it's just right for the company to take the interval between "people who wear flashy clothes" and "people who wear plain clothes".

What are you worried about?
Do living things have a habit of not wanting to leave the place where they were born?

That's how humans spread from Africa to the whole world.
Do you mean people who are envious of others?
Annoying is not about someone who is envious of the other person, but to be envious of the other person.

Why am I such a bad guy
That's probably because I'm comparing myself to a really good guy.
Because you compare it with someone, you end up being excellent, amazing, or useless.
Is it my own?
At least it's not a "bad guy" if you put out a personal best.
Recent ramen, back fat bar, kimchi, it's spicy!
Bad taste!
No light ramen, soy sauce ramen or pork bone light ramen?
I don't need a Korean style!
Chinese soba noodles in a dining room in the old town!
It's OK at restaurants that serve rice bowls, udon noodles, and soba noodles.
I also like ramen like that.
Hida Takayama ramen and Kitakata ramen are light.
I'm going to an interview for a part-time job at a supermarket tomorrow.

・Time travel time from home to work
・Transportation expenses
・Whether you have a part-time job experience
Why did you choose this job?
・Days and times of shift to enter
I think you'll be asked at least as much as this!
Under the Japanese Constitution, if one of them has to change its surname?
It's the Civil Code, not the Constitution.
Have you ever been infected with the flu?
Has it taken quite a few times?
I forgot about the past, maybe a few times?
I think so.
I don't remember having the flu for more than 50 years since I became a working adult, but 5 or 6 years ago, when I had the antibody value measured in the city, I had enough antibody values.
Also, I don't remember getting the vaccine, but I think I was probably infected with the flu without knowing it, and I was able to develop antibodies without knowing it.

The table from Corona is a tray.
It seems that housework is easy

There are many such circles, and if you invite me, I will go to basketball.
Of course, even beginners are welcome.
When I was watching a commercial for a Showa car on YouTube, I thought that the purchasing power was aroused along with the music.
I think the Honda commercial was good.
I thought that the popular actors and actresses were not actively appointed in the Showa car commercials.
No, there were a lot of commercials for celebrities.
The atmosphere is definitely more fashionable than it is now.
It was a little while ago, but I've been feeling uneasy for a long time, so please.
I was admitted to the hospital for surgery for an enlarged prostate, but since I was hospitalized for two months, there was almost no benefit from the high-cost medical expenses system.
(Because it is the standard for one month)
Is it possible for a doctor to deliberately make this two months?
Probably because it's Corona.
If it's not life-threatening, it's a triage.
Should I say to clear the misunderstanding?
Can you solve it as soon as you say it?
If the other person is convinced that it is a misunderstanding, I think that it will be misunderstood.
How about saying it?

I didn't have an MBA to manage my own money, so it's not a problem.
Does it take a few days to heal once the lymph nodes swell?
I think it may be due to the swelling.
If you have an infection such as a cold, you will probably catch the cold once heals.
The doctor told me that if the swelling is too severe and the pain is painful, the doctor said that it will not heal without taking antibiotics, so it may be better to go to the hospital once.
Can you run longer than 5th grade?
Absolutely impossible! !

Manga... Even if you're not good at drawing, can you read the story as long as it's interesting?
Will you keep reading?

I haven't decided on the character design yet because it's rough, but I'm going to make it darker from the first page!
A manga that comes with drawing power.
You can't even pick it up when you're not good at drawing.
Do you get mad if your wife tries to eat frozen food from time to time?
First of all, I'm worried about my health.
After that, it's fine if you can make good frozen food, but if it tastes bad or doesn't taste good, you might get angry.
We may work together to find out how to do better frozen foods or how to do better.
A simple question.

Is that so?
Thank you for your hard work today.
Right.
I think it's good to analyze why it failed so that it doesn't fail next time.

It's easy for the actors to read
With Toru Emori's sour voice...
One book in about two days.
About 15 books per month.
You can borrow it from the library, or read it again from what you read a long time ago.
I don't want to read it, but to pass the time.
I think each has its pros and cons.
What are the pros and cons of the car you drive?

The skirt length is a bit too subtle...
Please give me your advice.

Is the air conditioner blown from the outdoor unit?
How do you get the wind out?
With the power of the fan of the indoor unit, the air is drawn in through the air intake of the indoor unit and the air is exhaled from the indoor unit's air outlet.
When changing the temperature of the air, the outdoor unit turns to operate the heat exchanger, but if it's just the ventilation, it's not necessary, so the outdoor unit doesn't get involved.
If I ask the store clerk to give me a case of a giant cone of ice cream, will they sell it for me?
If you have stock in the backyard and there is no problem with the number of items you can put in the store, you may be able to accept it, but not only giant cone, dry batteries, sweets, bread, etc., so it is better to contact them to make a reservation in advance.
When I asked for 30 pieces of ice cream for club activities, I asked for it in advance.

It's the same Christian country, but it's a different country due to the difference of sects (British = Church of England, Ireland = Catholic).
I'm looking for a popular gaming router that doesn't support Wi-Fi6 wireless LAN
Due to various circumstances, construction cannot be done, so I know well that it doesn't make much sense unless it's Wi-Fi6, so on top of that.
Please let me know if you know that this is good.
Thank you very much.
It's harder to find products that don't support Wi-Fi6 now, so
I think that a Wi-Fi6 product is good because it supports terminals which are not supported normally.

Of course, it is slowing down from the front of Yamashina.

Training
Which is better for muscle training, before dinner or after dinner?
Training when you're running out of energy (empty abdomen) will help you lose muscle
If you take in nutrition (mainly protein) after training, it will be easier for your muscles to grow.
So, if you're going to do it seriously, you need to replenish before and after training.
However, if you choose either before or after, I think it is better to train after eating.

Automotive studless tires Does it have anything to do with driving on snowy roads even if the air pressure is high?
If the air pressure is increased, will the fuel consumption be improved a little?
Shouldn't it be quite high?
I think the rolling resistance will improve.
Since studless tires are low-pressure tires, there is no good thing, such as high pressure, it will not bite the snow and it will be easier to burst.

Also, will you wear it on Eight Day?
There is a picture of Odaiba United States 2013 in the same costume, so I guess so.
I didn't know if it would be worn on Eight Day.

I've been to several different dentists so far, but when I'm sitting on a chair for that treatment, I see a teacher or a dental hygienist who speaks diagonally from behind.
I'm not sure if it's better to turn around, but I think it's rude if you're facing backwards because it's hard to look back all the time. .

Yes
When will the amount that I applied for on the tax return at the beginning of the year be transferred to my account?

A postcard will be sent to you that you will have to transfer it by postcard first, so please register your passbook when it arrives, because it has been transferred.
For the time being, I have no choice but to wait for the postcard (notification).

Vegetable juice.

Disappointed with problems
I bought it to rely on the popular pressurized innerwear because I don't have much time to exercise.
My body type is H175m W80kg I bought the L size.
It's quite difficult to wear at first, but I think it's okay once you get used to it.
I've been using it for a few days, but now I'm using other pressurized innerwear due to a problem.
As for the problem, 1, if the circumference of the arm is not quite slender, the tightness around the edge of the sleeve (just the upper arm) is too tight and it is itchy.
2. The lower abdomen is loose.
It's quite tight in terms of comfort, but you can sleep while wearing it.
Good for those who get along
158 cm, 50 kg was fine.
But it didn't suit me, who has a big skeleton and is muscular.
Since the buttocks are not three-dimensionally made, there are strange gaps and it is easy to fall and it does not feel good.
It felt like I had to pull it up all the time.
I think it's good if you have a body like a stick.
In terms of thickness, is it a safe thin?
It doesn't look like henna henna or tears, but even with perfect knee-high boots, I was able to get in boots and feel refreshed.
Wonderful
I don't want to show my upper body too much, but I've come across a different fitness swimsuit.
The top is a stylish laid back view and a one-point mark on the hem.
I'm happy to be able to choose between the bottom bikini or shorts, or 2 ways (^.
^) It's just arrived, and I just tried it on, so I don't know how it would look if it got wet, but the sewing was beautiful and the fabric was solid.
There was no wire on the bust part, but when I touched it, it seems that there is a hard core at the bottom of the pad.
However, it doesn't hurt even if I wear it, and I think it looks good when I move because it follows my bust properly.
Did you change the model from without a pad?
(^.
^) From now on, I'm looking forward to going into the water ♪ Thank you very much ♪
45kg 156mm size, a little big.
The raincoat is made of thick fabric, so it feels hot and humid.
It has 2 rain protection visors to prevent your face from getting wet.
There was no problem with the strength, and it was safe to use even on a bicycle in a storm.
It didn't break after use.
I put it in a compression bag to keep it compact and carry it around.
It's actually more than I expected at this price.
I was able to put it on safely.
The CLA 180 Shooting Break has been installed in the 2016 model.
Even amateurs can do the mounting method by reading YOU TUBE and the manual.
Note that if you loosen the Torx screw too much, the screw will fall into the car.
I fell one and went missing.
After that, if you use a type with a tapered tip such as radio pliers when you put the gray connector between the brown and red-green wiring, you will not be able to apply force evenly, and the plastic will crack as shown in the picture and you will not be able to install it.
When I called support, they sent me a new cable the next day and the company is very supportive.
When I re-challenge, I put a lot of effort into it with wide pliers like the one in the manual picture and it worked well.
When I put the last main unit back in the car, I had to have some tricks to store the wiring, but I managed to install it.
You can watch the DVD, TV, and navigation while driving without any problems after installation.
If you order from a dealer, it costs over 80,000 yen, and even a specialty store costs over 40,000 yen, so I think it's a very cost-effective product.
Below the price
To be honest, I don't know why it's so highly rated first. Or rather, the overalls are small, so I thought about using it, but I think that the product with the head and the body pillow is one or not, and it may or may not fit. This time, I bought it for 3600 yen at a time sale, but I want to return it.
It's neither good nor bad.
Item arrived.
I was able to use it as soon as possible.
There is no problem with the feeling of use, and you can express milk properly.
However, there are times when the sound is a little noisy, and there are times when the power button does not respond well.
I don't mind using it without any problems, but people who are interested may be concerned about it.
It's not super quiet 😅 If you use it in the middle of the night, you might be a little careful.
Also, I was worried that the attached tube and the part connecting the machine would fit into the tube, but I pushed it in 😂 I think it's easy to carry because it's lightweight!
You need a trick to lather...
I'm not sure if it's the worst compatibility with my hair quality, or if it's a matter of the performance of this shampoo, but it doesn't lather at all in normal usage.
(The shampoos I've used so far have lathered up even when I use them normally.) So here's the solution I found ↓ ①First of all, take a little less shampoo than usual and apply it to your hair as a whole.
(At this point, it doesn't foam at a level where no foam appears.) ②Wash your hair once, then take an appropriate amount of shampoo and apply it to your hair.
(With this, it finally foams up normally.) Well, in short, it's washed twice lol The shampoo itself has a very small capacity, so the trick is to reduce the amount of shampoo as much as possible for the first time... I'm satisfied with the effect of the shampoo itself.
It's clear that I bought a shampoo that's so expensive, but I felt that my hair had a better texture.
However, my honest impression is that I was not satisfied with the overall review.
It's a pity that the Quattrobotanico series was taken care of by the facial cleanser...
Even though the capacity is small, the cost performance is bad because it is forced to wash twice.
In addition, considering the scent that everyone does not like, I will give it a little strict 2 stars here.
Evaluation is difficult
There is a negative positive and it is difficult to evaluate.
The front side of the blade is clean with just the cleaner of the blade.
I think that matching with a razor with good accuracy of the original blade is good.
Posi: As intended, dirt on the blade such as sebum and soap scum can be removed.
(Only the front side) If the dirt and the sharpness deteriorate, it will last a long time.
Negative: The life of the smoother is extremely reduced.
Titanium coats, ceramic coats, etc. coated on the edge of the cutting edge are more likely to peel off.
(I think it's better to use this cleaner afterwards, as most of the coating will come off if you use a shaving about 2-3 times.
Be careful with the razor that says not to wipe the tip of the blade.
) It's possible to use a tipping prevention rubber (vibration rubber) to put under the furniture used to prepare for earthquakes, so it's not worth it in terms of cost performance.
*The life of the razor of 20 to 30% that I use is increased.
It's difficult to determine when a razor blade is thrown away, but I think it was when the blade was damaged by shaving and the tip of the blade became rattled.
In that sense, I think it's a good product because it can prevent sharpness due to dirt.
(It's just a cleaner and doesn't have the effect of sharpening. There are times when it feels like it's being sharpened, but I think it feels like it's the small rust.)
I've been tempted by TV commercials...
I bought it when I saw the face of an elderly woman pulled up just by applying it once with a TV commercial.
When I actually used it, the texture was a little harder than a normal gel, and I wipe it off with a pre-lotion before using it.
It feels sticky at first, but if you apply it while massaging it, it will get into your skin unexpectedly.
After entering, it was almost not sticky, and my skin felt like it was sticking to my hands.
After all, the lifting person did not work like TV.
I felt a sense of firmness just once.
I have super dry skin, so this one is not enough, so I used a certain Moisture Surge 72 before using it.
It feels just right.
I expected it to cover the looseness of the pores, but it was not.
If you try using a bottle, it may be effective, or if there is, I think there is a repeat.
It must have been difficult to put together...
It is a work that summarizes the statements of politicians in the past several years.
As I read it, I am somewhat convinced that that statement at that time was argued after all.
However, when considering the value as a reading material, it is subtle whether it can be said that the "fact check" that the author calls alone is sufficient.
To be honest, it's not interesting to read.
I thought about it, but I felt that the major drawback of this book was in the "method".
Ultimately, no one knows whether what is called "fact" here is forever.
I felt that it was quite suspicious because of the writing, whether the person himself was aware of the fragility of the "fact check" (maybe it's disproportionability).
When it comes to this level of perceptions of the "facts" of Japanese journalists, I feel a little gloomy.
It seems that there are many people who recommend it, but it may be suitable for those who want some knowledge of the content of this book.
If there are readers like the reviewers who are interested in "fact-checking" conducted by the Japanese mass media today, I think this book will not suit you.
For those who can't improve their scores on mock exams.
At my school, the political economy was a printing method, and the class was like studying while being forced to do it.
To be honest, this reference book saved me.
現在高3で今年センター。
I chose this as my partner for one hour of studying to and from school after I bought it in March.
First impressions are easy to understand.
You've reached the realm of God.
When I finished one lap and took the past questions, I was 40 at the time, which was the average of 70.
As expected, I was surprised even myself.
It grows as if you've eaten something strange.
What I can get from this reference book is not only the knowledge and information about politics and economics, but also the improvement of my own skills and motivation for studying.
Thank you for letting me meet you.
Prevention of crime
Eight years ago, I experienced an attempt at the entrance twice and took crime prevention measures.
This is a replacement from the camera I bought 8 years ago.
In the past, I used infrared irradiation 30m type (other company).
As others have written about this product, the distance that can be recognized at night is about 5m.
I have the same opinion.
It has just arrived and has not been set up, but we are at the stage of comparing and checking the appearance of the camera and checking the defects.
The image quality is much better than the camera 8 years ago (of course).
I split it into 4 parts on a 32-inch monitor, but there is no problem if the shooting size is maximized.
So far, there are no problems with the product.
In addition to crime prevention, you may be dissatisfied with night photography, especially for those who are considering a level that allows facial recognition, but at this price it is the best!
It's for crime prevention, but I haven't asked for facial recognition.
Because you can't tell if you're wearing a mask or a mask (especially at night).
Professional burglaries (thieves) have the knowledge of security cameras.
Even if it is small, it is possible to distinguish between a high-performance camera and a recording.
On the contrary, if you're not a professional, you'll be in trouble.
However, burglaries these days are bold and clever, so I recommend using them with various security goods instead of relying only on cameras.
For example, it is a white solar LED garden light that can be obtained at a home center for about 1,500 yen (the latest one is very bright, which is very bright).
Since it's solar, you don't have to pay for electricity, but it doesn't light up until morning in winter, so there are 3 100V human LED sensor lights.
With this combination, we were able to secure a distance of 30m that we could recognize a figure.
Also, for those who think that the threatening effect will be reduced because it is a daytime crime prevention and the camera is small, I think it is necessary to devise a cover.
I have a sticker that says "24-hour security camera is working".
It is the original product of the security camera manufacturer that I used before.
The manufacturer's products are more effective than sticking the items sold at the home center.
The place to be pasted is a thief's entryway that cannot be covered by camera shooting.
In that sense, I wanted a sticker this time.
At the same time, it is a minus because it is difficult to understand the instruction manual of the Internet setting.
If there are any defects after setting up and setting, I will add it.
I sympathize so much that it hurts to read
If you were born in 1982 in Japan, your social situation may be a little better than her, but the fact that the Equal Employment Law is enforced is still far from being even.
As I read on, the painful memories of living through discrimination as a member of society, such as ah, that was true, and I felt suffocated.
It depicts the suffering of not only Korea and Japan, but also the feudal society that all women who try to live as human beings, not as women.
At the very least, isn't it time to stop emotional conflicts and face this society with shoulders together?
A drama that makes you think "Man is the worst"
The story of the main character who was sexually abused by his biological father when he was a child.
Of course, even when I grow up, I continue to drag the wounds.
All the men who come out are the worst.
In a sense, the main character's husband, who seems to be warm and family, is also the worst.
There are spoilers ↓ Even if the main character's younger sister is receiving domestic violence from her husband, she ignores it.
The main character's old mother, who pretends to be stupid, knows that her husband (the main character's biological father) was killed by her daughter, but her daughter doesn't know about it (publicly, the death of her biological father is overdose).
In short, it seems that after the death of a rape old man, she didn't get counseling from her daughter, so it's only natural that the main character would go crazy.
Did the main character's daughter want to hear about her dead grandfather?
Do you care about the old man who died so young?
in the drama? is too much.
A few years ago, a heat wave hit France, and many old people died, and many French people said, "I can't get it because I'm on vacation," and the hospitals and facilities were reported to be full of morgues in Paris.
These people are ""Dry".
At the end of the drama, when I saw my husband and daughter, I felt that it was "dry".
French ones are completely different from those in the United States, and many of them have a good aftertaste with a vague part, but I watched a relatively large number of scenes that I thought would be better to cut them.
Professional borderline
If the precise calculations and the unexpected accidents that were not readable were something that affects someone's life, even if they had calculated from the beginning to some extent, they must have thought that they were worth bet on their own.
The script, which embodies such a subtle and swaying drama, was wonderful, as to how far she would deceive those around her to fight against her own conflicts that she could not see in an open field and to pass her beliefs.
Even with that... Jessica's acting is really amazing.
No matter what you look at, you can't go wrong.
It's a professional job.
The feeling of use has failed since then.
I've used 3 of them so far, but this product broke in no time, both in a good way and in a bad way.
I used the built-in vaporizer of the first 2200mA, which was the reason why I chose this product, but the battery ran out in 3 sessions of 200 degrees for 3 sessions.
The second USB terminal is bad.
Cannot be charged.
This time, this product was a product to solve the problem so far, but after reinserting the battery about 15 times (I used the battery with the charger so that the USB terminal would not break), the contact became difficult, and it became difficult to turn on the power.
Press the lid to turn on the power.
If you're an IQOS user, I'm sure some of you have experienced it.
That symptom.
As mentioned in the notes, batteries are not used except for the attached batteries.
The claws and catches are like they are cut out, so it doesn't seem to bend.
Therefore, it was returned in about 10 days.
I bought the Starry logo at the same time as the return, but I will describe the contents compared with this one.
Appearance size, the same.
Chambers and draws are the same.
The LCD is more beautiful.
It may be newer than without a logo.
Vibe This is modest.
It's like a smartphone vibe.
Without the logo, the vibration of the vibrator or the sound is loud.
A cheap Chinese smartphone.
This product is also Chinese.
Attachments are slightly different.
This one comes with a liquid case.
Without a logo, it is a mass like steel wool.
That's what it feels like.
I think Starry would have been better, but if it breaks quickly, it will lose credibility.
I wanted to exchange it, but I could only choose a return, so I proceeded with the procedure even though it was troublesome.
It's just ear rubber, but ear rubber
This flat rubber doesn't really hurt.
It's the best similar mask I've used so far.
Even with a flat rubber, it may twist, and the twisted helicopter may rub against the base of the ear, causing more pain than the round rubber. However, I think that this product is not only soft to the touch, but also makes it difficult to twist.
The three-dimensional fit to the face is good, and it not only fits, but also creates a moderate space between the nose wire and the lower side of the jaw, which creates a moderate space in front of the mouth, making it difficult to breathe.
Maybe it's because it fits the size of your face.
I don't know if it will fit everyone in the same way, but if you think that all of the other small sizes are not good, you should try it once.
When I opened the outer box, it was in the plastic of the central slit like a box tissue, but when I took out the first one, the ear rubbers on both sides got caught and it was difficult to take it out, so I reduced one star by that amount.
The dealer's response is 1 star
The price and taste are perfect, but I was distrustful of the dealers who ignored it and sent it even though the date was specified.
In addition to this product, I bought a drink in bulk.
Since I always buy from Amazon, I am acquainted with the delivery person.
In particular, I tried to match the arrival date as much as possible, as it would carry heavy objects to the top, but it was ruined.
Amazon says it's hard because of Amazon's fault, but I'm thinking that there is even one thing that the user can cooperate with.
I'm disappointed in the response of the arrogant trader.
But the price is cheap.
If you consider purchasing, including disposal costs
There are a lot of dissatisfaction, so I don't think it can be used for a long time.
I think it's a good idea to consider including the cost of disposing of it.
As a reference, it seems that some local governments have a center that accepts free or cheap garbage if you bring it in.
[Comfort to sit] The seat is slightly slanted to the left and is further wobbly, so sitting down is very tiring.
If you move even a little, it makes a loud noise.
It's noisy at night and can't be used.
This is my biggest concern, and I feel like I can't keep using it.
[Assembly] Assembling instructions are only rough pictures.
There is a lack of information required for assembly, and there are many errors.
・There is no explanation about the orientation of the seat and the fixing base when the support is installed. There are some people who say that it tilts forward in the review, but there is a possibility that the direction in which the seat surface and the fixing platform are installed is the opposite direction.
When installed correctly, the height adjustment lever is on the right side, facing backwards, and the dial to adjust the spring on the back is the front.
However, since the height adjustment lever is more natural to be forward, many people will accidentally install it.
There are no basic precautions in the manual, and you will be assembled while doing trial and error while looking at rough pictures.
・There is an error in the explanation of the contents The contents list at the beginning of the manual is incorrect.
It seems that many buyers end up looking for 8x20mm screws, which are included with 12 of them.
The 8x20mm screws are already inserted into the chair side, so be careful not to find them in vain.
It seems that there are combinations of screw holes and screws that can be inserted with screw holes and combinations that cannot be inserted.
In some combinations, it is very difficult just to insert the screw into the screw hole.
Therefore, it can be imagined that it is being shipped with a screw inserted like this.
Also, the spare screw in the manual was not found.
[Others] The black part of the surface of the vinyl leather has uneven coloring and is whitish here and there.
Explanation of defects in the instruction manual and supplementary explanation of the above installation method, etc. have arrived at the e-mail address registered with Amazon 2-3 days after the arrival of the product.
These items should be released immediately after the product is shipped.
It is a completely meaningless act because many buyers have completed the assembly within 2-3 days after the product arrives.
Hmm...
I've been a big fan of Thermos and have been using the thermos straw type for over 15 years, but this model is by far the most difficult to use. .
(1) The spout parts of the straws are made of harder than before, and the grooves become more sticky to the main body.
! When I desperately tried to remove it, my nails cracked. .
(2) Only the tip of the spout of the straw is thinner than before, and the straw brush can no longer enter.
(3) The mysterious part called the valve attached to the tip of the straw is thicker than the straw brush and is dramatically more difficult to wash.
It's a bit of a shock because I've never been dissatisfied with using a straw type so far.
It's really stressful that you can't take a taste from the main unit.
The good thing is that it still has excellent cooling power.
When I forgot to take it out of my bag and washed it the next day, there was still about 50% of the ice left in it the day before.
I don't drink HOT, so I'm a straw type person from now on.
Please improve the following models.
First review (with additional photos)
This is my first review.
(This is my first time purchasing a doll from scratch, and I am not an amateur who has little knowledge of wearing a doll eye.) I received the product as shown in the picture.
When I put it on the Obitsu doll, it was very cute and I was very satisfied with the light.
However, when you put it on (entrance) a little hard, you can't put it on unless you push it with force.
I think it's a different way to do it, but I put tweezers in the hole of the doll eye and pushed it in.
About shipping It's the first time it's been shipped from overseas, so I used it for three weeks, but it arrived sooner than I expected (near Narita Airport) than I expected.
However, I was worried because the shipping email was never sent.
Looking at Amazon's shipping statement earlier, it says it's still being shipped.
There was no damage and no air in the eyes, and there were a lot of bubble wraps on the back of the envelope and it was in a small sealed bag, so I think it's safe.
However, since the phone number was printed on an envelope, is it okay to use personal information even though it is an e-mail service from overseas?
I have a question, so I'm going to set it to minus 1.
I think that the product is a great bargain at this price without any problems.
Postscript Doll eye 8mm model iPhone SE
Slightly small (the work area is narrow), the charge is severe
I ordered it after looking at the size notation, but it felt twice as small as I had imagined.
Although it is larger than the A4 size, the outer circumference is a groove for parts stock, so the range that can be used for work is narrower than the A4.
I was thinking of using it when repairing electronic devices or creating gunpla, but it's hard to use without B4 size.
If you use a different tray or mat for other tasks such as assembly and disassembly, you may be able to do it somehow.
It is not possible to place tools, place parts, and do more work within the size of a magazine.
I thought about ordering another same item to double the area, but the charge was so bad that I was working hard, and even the dust and cut parts sticking to it, so I think it would be difficult to keep using it.
fatal defective product
The lid of the battery box didn't open, and after I had a hard time using a rubber non-slip sheet, I finally opened the lid.
It's out at this point.
Highly rated ones!
Will the battery box lid close? ? ?
In addition, a small fluffy saran wrap was attached instead of the product protective seal.
Is this a second hand item? ? ?
Speaking of the explanation, only the English sentences are written on a small piece of paper.
I don't understand the operation method at all.
Good for other fingers...
I found a good product!
I bought it immediately.
I use it for pinky rings, so if I don't use it a lot, it won't be perfect, and it's a little rough.
But I think it's good for other fingers.
But I think he's a good idea merchant.
For the price
After all, you shouldn't ask for quality for this kind of product.
One flower mark was destroyed.
The size is just right when I put it on.
It may be difficult for people with thick earlobes.
It might have been better to buy a pattern without a pattern.
It's dangerous
The design is good, but when you put it on your hand, it won't fade even if you put it on your feet.
Eastern Hokkaido in the harsh winter...
As other reviewers have said, the heating wires are only net of 110 x 80, and the placement is horizontal instead of vertically.
I bought it because I wanted to warm the entire futon, so I bought it because it's more expensive than the floor type, but it's not too big.
There is no choice but to use it in combination with the hot water bottle and the N-warm of 〇tori.
By the way, the quality of blankets is out of the question.
It's well done
It's small and has enough airflow.
Batteries can also be replaced with spares.
If you put it on the desk and adjust the angle, it will be fine if you do it as shown in the picture.
If it's a smooth desk, it will blow away with your own wind power, but if you put a handkerchief on it, there's no problem.
If you use it outside/family restaurant, you won't notice the sound even if it is "medium", but in the office it's noisy and noisy.
It is necessary to have a split as an accompaniment when going out.
Also, for office use, even if it is "small", the air volume is too much and it is too cold.
It's perfect for scenes where you sweat a lot on the go and run into a family restaurant and cool it all at once with a "large".
However, when you throw it in your bag, the power button is often pressed and it is left spinning without knowing it.
It would be nice if there was a way to retract the button slightly (caves it down), or hold down the weak first push.
It's a must-have item in a life-threatening era of intense heat, so it would be helpful if you could make something better.
Multifunctional light speaker
I put it in the bedroom and use it as the weakest warm color.
Better than you think!
I'm glad I bought it.
As a light, you can adjust the luminosity and color by touch.
The white color goes well with any room, and the color light changes with a gradation, so it's beautiful.
Also, if you touch it with your favorite color, it will stop with your favorite color, so you can make it shine according to your mood!
Because it is an LED type, you can expect a long life.
As for the sound quality, as an amateur, I think it's more than enough to satisfy my ears.
Also, the great thing about this light is that it has many functions.
・There is a large speaker on the top.
You can enjoy music wirelessly because you can pair with your mobile phone, etc., with Bluetooth pairing.
You can also make hands-free calls by pairing with your mobile phone.
・In addition, since it is compatible with microSD, it can be linked with a computer, and you can play music as an MP3 player.
Dimming and piano practice
At the age of 66, he started trying DTM to prevent blurring.
Buy an audio interface and this instrument.
At first, I was typing, but I fell in love with playing the piano, and I spend my days practicing every day.
I downloaded the sound source, but the protection didn't go well, so I downloaded ASIO at first.
I'm glad I bought it.
I feel like I've been deceived by my appearance.
Is it a product that is hit or miss?
It will be a long sentence.
Since the synthetic leather of the office chair (flip-up armrest) made by Doshisha, which has been used for 4 to 5 years, has deteriorated and has become tattered, so I purchased a non-synthetic leather chair with a flip-up armrest.
I searched for home centers and furniture stores, but there was nothing suitable.
I'm worried that I can't see the actual product, but I bought this product on Amazon because I compromised on the appearance and price of the design.
The product box is surprisingly light and compact.
There is one spare screw.
[Caution] The attached hex wrench and screws are sticky with oil.
At first, I couldn't see the oil sticking to the hex wrench, so I was in a hurry when the oil got on the body.
Completed assembly in 40 minutes.
Completed product check.
The flip-up armrest has a different hardness to lift and lower on the left and right, the left side is heavy, the right side is light, and the armrest is not easy to use (there is no adjustment method).
The angle adjustment of the movable headrest has a weak fixing force, and it immediately hangs down with a "click" sound.
The non-regenerative high-density urethane foam feels hard and is not comfortable to sit on (weak elasticity?
) The mesh for the backrest is harder than other companies' mesh chairs, and the back pain is sore if you wear light clothes.
It's a small detail, but the height from the seat to the ground was 530 instead of 550 (the height of the sitting height is important for tall people).
I put a cushion that I bought separately, and I use a towel blanket because the mesh fabric is likely to deteriorate (damage) quickly.
I'm 186 cm and 80 kg, so I felt that the fit on my back was good, but other than that, I think it's a product with a low satisfaction, and I feel that it's a hit or miss product.
After all, it may be better to buy an office chair by looking at the actual item.
Since there was an Amazon email from the manufacturer stating the purchase greetings, would you like to inquire about the armrest and headrest?
Under consideration.
Well, is it something like this?
I bought a Pixela 4K tuner, which was cheap, without expecting too much because it seems that I can see the BS4K on the right side of my house.
As an experiment, free right-turning broadcasts such as NHK BS4K can be seen again, and I can watch it beautifully on the Panasonic 4K TV that I purchased at the same time.
(Occasionally, the images are jerky) The update came soon after the purchase, and since it became compatible with recording, I've made some scheduled recordings and watched it.
The user interface is not complimented by any means, and I've taken it as "you can watch 4K broadcasts."
By the way, it seems that you can only follow the recorded programs during scheduled recording, and we accept this as a plus function that can be recorded on the HDD in 4K.
You may be disappointed if you buy with various expectations, so don't expect too much.
I hope the update will improve.
Thermal insulation function is OK
I've only used it for the heat insulation function, but when I put two 500ml PET bottles in about 2 hours, it warmed up and it felt hot in 2 and a half hours.
I installed it at the foot of the passenger seat of a compact car and used it.
I was worried about the smell of chemical substances being discharged from the fans because it was still new, so I needed to open the windows regularly to ventilate.
As other people have written in the review, the burrs in the part where the shoulder strap is passed is terrible, so it is necessary to break the burr with a flathead screwdriver.
Really fragile
Today, I started using it and it broke up suddenly 2 months ago.
I liked the feel and the size of the key, but it doesn't make sense if it breaks.
I've been using a PC all day for video processing, but the volume is 100% without permission.
Even if it is lowered, it will return to 100% in an instant.
Earphones hurt my ears and can't be used, and I feel intimidated using a PC at night.
It seems that a signal is being sent every few seconds, and the volume display repeats on and off on the computer screen.
In addition, the keyboard interferes with the instructions of the mouse, so you can't use the mouse freely unless you turn off the keyboard one by one.
Enter keys and backspace keys no longer respond.
I don't recommend it at all, but if it's a thousand yen, you might want to buy it as a trial.
If you're lucky, you can use it for about half a year.
Even if other companies are made with the same price range, this is a 6-month warranty compared to the 1-3 year warranty.
The short warranty period speaks to its fragile.
Good product, bad packaging
The product is my favorite because it has a different color.
If you are looking for a food stocker, I would definitely recommend it! !
However, there was a gap in the large cardboard that rolled around, and the invoice was not included, so the packaging was the worst.
When I opened the box, the lid was also off.
We recommend the product, but it may be better to buy it elsewhere.
I'm worried about the strength, but for now
When I bought a new lid, the support became uneasy, so I bought it.
It plays a role in terms of the stability of the lid, but since it's a delicate plastic product, if you don't pay attention to opening and closing the lid, it will make an unpleasant sound like "It's likely to break."
You have to choose something that matches the thickness of the lid, so be careful when purchasing.
Back with cute meatballs
When I was looking for a bag to keep a dog, I was attracted to the stylish gray bag and bought this one.
It's a assembled type, and when you hold it, it's surprisingly light, so it didn't feel that heavy even if you had it.
The zipper moves smoothly and there is nothing like getting caught.
It seems easy even for long trips.
It's very compact and easy to fold.
Even if you fold it, you can see the design of the paws, and it's cute even if you put it on it.
Light and comfortable!
The pulley is also comfortable to use.
First of all, I fell in love with the appearance and the low price at first sight! I bought it.
TSA locks are my favorites for several years now, and I have several others, but it's convenient, isn't it?
Also, a number lock is recommended as a master of forgetting keys and losing.
However, to be honest, it's good because I put the most important point in lightness. If you cut it, it will break in an instant.
Also, since the zipper is loose, I would like to devise a way to overlap.
It is recommended to carry it on board if it is overseas.
For the time being, I used it on a trip on the Shinkansen, but it was comfortable.
It's difficult to choose the size...
I'm having a hard time buying shoes because they are wide.
Converse and buns are wearing 24cm.
The MRL996 is also 24cm.
Is it hard at first? That's what I thought, but it's fine when you get used to it.
The ML574 this time was certainly tough when my sister said that 24.5 cm was tough, and when she let me wear it.
It felt like my little finger hit me.
Therefore, I bought a 25cm.
When it arrives, it's big...
When you put it on, it's a little loose even if you wear socks.
I was worried about returning it, but it would be a hassle if the 24.5 was tough, so I'm going to put it in the insole and put it on.
I bought a team red and it's very good with bright red!
There are many black and white monotone clothes, so wearing them will brighten up your clothes!
165cm, 40's male
I ordered the L size appropriately, but if the specs are similar to the one below, we recommend the M size.
Height: 165 cm Weight: 60 kg Waist: 81 cm Navel circumference: 100 cm A typical metabolic belly.
 In the water, the rash guard will turn up, probably because the waist is loose.
I'm swimming while fixing the turned up part.
Especially when you're careless with a jacuzzi, your metabolic belly is completely exposed.
Also, if you walk while moving up and down, it will turn up from the bottom.
 The fabric is durable and not too thin, so you don't have to worry about your nipples being transparent.
At this price, you can be satisfied with this construction, but I think the smaller one will fit.
It's still a gas leak...
The Silver Colt 25 was still leaking gas. There was a problem that part of the tank was missing when the valve was replaced, but [Basbon Do Q], sealing the tank and fixing it up can be done smoothly, and those who want to buy this Colt 25 can disassemble and assemble it. Whether you ask someone who can do it or can do it, or take a digital camera photo, you can't take it apart, so I can't recommend it to people who aren't confident, even if it breaks. It might be fun for people who think it's good. I also bought another black Colt 25. The trick to disassembling is to press the trigger with the thumb of the left hand. I managed to disassemble it without flying the left side, but when I assembled it, I applied silicone grease to springs and small parts. I assembled it while fixing it with grease. When disassembling, first remove the grip, remove the safety screw, and remove the safety. Remove the two screws on the body and do not scratch the tip of the barrel so as not to pinch the front sight and inner barrel with pliers. You can get rid of it, then you can disassemble it by slowly removing the left side of the monaka structure.
I was wondering what the quality is 188 yen
You can use different times when you need fast turning and when you need torque.
It's light and small, and above all, it's good to be simplicity.
There was no rattling when I installed the bits, and I thought that 188 yen would be an amazing cost performance.
What about durability?
It may not be used very often, but I think it's good to put it in the tool box.
I bought this together with the same seller, "1/4" Hex Shank Magnetic Quick Release Driver Knurlet Bit Holder 60/100/150 mm".
There was no problem, or rather, it was quite good for the price.
Controller not working
The machine moves on its own and becomes inoperable.
Once the cable is reconnected, it can be operated, but after a few minutes, the machine moves in the wrong direction and becomes unable to operate.
It is better not to buy this item.
I'll warn you all.
It's a terrible product.
Although it is wired, I recommend the Beboncool PS3 controller.
It is highly reliable and has been used for a long time and has not been broken yet.
It can also be used for PC games.
Addendum: I was able to get a refund of the Amazon gift certificate for the return of the defective product within a month, so I think it was good.
Will this improve the calculation power?
I think it's suitable for children who understand calculations.
Isn't it impossible unless you are a child who understands the calculation to some extent?
The problem is hard to understand.
Also, when giving tools to the master, I try to slide the object on the screen with my finger, but no matter how many times I try it, it doesn't go smoothly.
In short, it may be easier for people who are accustomed to DS to slide. ?
I don't like illustrations of cartoon characters, or rather, I think that DS and other things are interesting because of the interesting screen... For some reason I can't get close to them.
The method of calculation is also a way to compete with time, for example, how many questions you can answer correctly in how many minutes.
I understand how you feel about rushing on exams, but...wouldn't you be in a hurry to calculate it?
For some reason I don't like the sound of the gong when it's finished.
Even though you're working hard, wouldn't it be better to have a more pleasant sound?
I feel like I've lost 6,200 yen with this.
You can see the half of this price.
I'm sorry, this is why I ended up with 2 stars.
After all, Persona's songs are good!
Persona 3 has reached the ED.
I played 5 halfway through.
Persona 4 is already trocon with VITA.
What you can do hasn't changed since the previous Persona 4.
There is no story, so it feels shorter than the previous work.
The songs are really cool!
Just listening to it makes me feel better!
The characters in Persona 3 were the first to be HD, so I was impressed when I first saw them.
Junpei looked handsome (lol) Persona 5 is beautiful from the beginning, so it's not fresh... Considering that, I feel that 3 is more profitable.
As a sound game, I felt that 5 was easier to play than 3.
Persona 3 is mainly blue, but it was difficult to see if the background was dark.
Since 5 is mainly bright colors such as red and yellow, it is easy to see even if it overlaps with the background.
There are many assist functions, so even those who are not good at sound games can play it.
If you turn on the challenge function, it may become a chewy game for sound game experts.
The triple pack has a soundtrack, but it's not a bonus, but a set of 4, so if you like Persona songs, I recommend this one.
なんか残念
I bought it because I liked the color of the dial in the photo, but the actual product has a bluish tint, but it is similar to black or charcoal gray.
And it wasn't a double buckle.
That's why I was thinking about buying gold, but it's on hold so far It's cheap, so maybe I'll give up?
Postscript After posting the review, I received an apology and an email from the seller stating that it would be exchanged for a new product.
Subsequent processing was quick.
I think the service was very good despite the low price.
4 stars added to the correspondence After that, I bought gold as well.
I think the colors are pretty much the same as the one in the picture.
But after all, the buckle is not a double lock, and the difference from the explanatory photo is obvious.
That's the only disappointment.
The evening gets very heavy.
I used it for the SIM-free iPhone7s.
In the first setting, I didn't know how to do it after arriving in Korea and pointing to the SIM, so I asked a woman at the SK counter at Gimpo Airport to tell me (settings > Mobile > Communication > Turn on data roaming on), and I was able to do it well.
It seems that the manual attached to the product had little to do with it...?
However, around Gimpo Airport, I was grabbing 3G for a long time, probably because of the poor signal condition.
When I went out into the city, it became 4G.
In the evening or at night, communication became very heavy from time to time, but now that I think about it, I may have reached the upper limit of a maximum of hundreds of MB a day.
Better than I thought
I used the Softbank Z4 for 2 years, made it SIM-free and used it with Ymobile, and the Z4 was getting worse, so I was looking for a used Xperia, so I found this phone that I can use my wallet with a new wallet and purchased it.
Since I was using Mobile Suica, I was worried if I could use it properly, but there was no problem at all.
I bought the size, weight, and silver, so it looks like an iPhone 6? That's the impression.
I don't play games, so the processing speed is the same as the Z4, and I have the impression that it's a little faster. According to the review, it's slow to recognize fingerprints.
I thought it was amazing because it was like an iPhone. I also changed the Android version to Ver9, so I was satisfied with the shopping.
It's a little bit smaller and better than the strap hole * It's suitable for cases with strap holes. I haven't tested the water resistance. It's a little heavy.
